Classify U.S. land ownership into one of these:
1 Federal
2 State
3 Local
4 Corporate
5 Conservation
6 Association
7 Family

Use OWN1 and OWN2 only.

Heavy rules (refine ambiguous cases):

FEDERAL (1):
Federal agencies only: USDA, USFS, BLM, NPS, USFWS, DOI, DOD, BIA, Army Corps.
“National” or “American” is NOT Federal if business terms appear.

STATE (2):
Requires a true U.S. state name or “State of <State>”.
DNR, DOT, State Parks, State Forestry count only when tied to a real state name.
“Department of …” alone is NOT State.

LOCAL (3):
City, Town, County, Borough, Parish, Village, Municipality.
Local districts: Water, Sewer, Irrigation, Sanitation, Utilities, Fire, Police, School District, Road & Bridge.
If tied to a city/county → Local.

CORPORATE (4):
Corporate suffixes: LLC, Inc, Corp, Co, LP, LLP, Holdings, Partners, Group, Company, Solutions, Services, Industries.
Corporate wording overrides patriotic, conservation, or family-like phrasing.

CONSERVATION (5):
Nonprofit environmental groups: Conservancy, Conservation, Alliance, Council, Foundation, Habitat, Restoration, Land Trust.
Exclude corporate-sounding “Land Trust” names tied to real-estate firms.

ASSOCIATION (6):
Clubs, associations, fellowships, societies, congregations, churches if non-corporate.

FAMILY (7):
Family Trusts, Estates, Heirs, Ranches, Farms, plural surnames.
Do NOT override corporate suffixes.

Resolution order:
Federal → Local → State → Corporate → Conservation → Association → Family.

Return only the number.
